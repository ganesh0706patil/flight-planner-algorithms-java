# Flight Planner Algorithm

This Java project implements a Flight Planner using two algorithms:
- **Backtracking**: To explore all possible flight paths and find the optimal route.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: To find the most cost-effective or time-efficient route between two cities.

## Project Structure
- **backtracking/**: Contains the Java code for the backtracking algorithm.
- **dijkstra/**: Contains the Java code for Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **input/**: Contains the input flight data file (`largeData.txt`).

## How to Run
- *javac FlightPlannerApp.java
- *java FlightPlannerApp largeData.txt "SourceCity" "DestinationCity" output.txt
